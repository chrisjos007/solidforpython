# SOLID Programming

## Abstract

At times, when we are delving into new projects, we may often face the prospect of being accountable for the clumsy code we write. It is in no one's intention to write poot code, but without proper control and practice, we may get subjected to the chaos and end up with an ineptly written code. This is where the **SOLID Design Principles** come into action. In this paper, I will be briefly going through the SOLID design concept with a few code samples.

## Introduction to SOLID

 The SOLID design concept was introduced by Robert C. Martin in his 2000 paper, [*"Design Principles and Design Patterns"*](https://web.archive.org/web/20150906155800/http:/www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/Principles_and_Patterns.pdf). SOLID is an acronym which stands for

    1) Single Responsibility Principle
    2) Open and Closed Principle
    3) Liskov Substitution Principle
    4) Interface Segregation Principle
    5) Dependancy Inversion Principle
